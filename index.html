    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p id="back"> Her name was difficult to come up with. As we never really tought of having a dog, there were not many options to choose from, and she remained nameless for the first couple of days. Finally, my mom came up with the name of Xiori, which comes from the Japanese name "Shiori" and means "Guidance".</p>

    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <p id="personality">Xio likes to play a lot, but sometimes she goes crazy and might leave a scratch or two. She has catched some habits that make her unique, such as:</p>
    <ol> <!--ordered list-->

        <li>Break her toys</li>
        <li>Ask for food even if she is full</li>
        <li>Bark at anything</li>
        <li>Cry if you don't give her food</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Toys</h2>
